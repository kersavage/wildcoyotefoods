Wild Coyote Foods produces gourmet dressings and salsas. Everything made by
Wild Coyote Foods uses fresh products. We package all dressings and salsas in
glass jars for two reasons, it helps hold the quality of the product and
also plastic bottles tend to bleed into the product. Wild Coyote Foods products have a
4 month shelf life.<br><br>

<h3>Ranch Dressing</h3>
Our signature product is the ranch dressing. We offer this in both
regular and lite, and have added a few new ranch flavors as well. We have managed to
create a homemade Ranch flavor and added 4 month shelf life. We always use real Buttermilk which
helps keep the homemade Ranch flavor. Once people taste our Ranch they have a hard time eating any
other. The Lite Ranch is our same great flavor with 63% less fat. It is hard to find a great Lite Ranch and
we have it.

<h3>Blue Cheese</h3>
The Blue Cheese dressing we use top of the line blue cheese crumbles,
which causes the blue cheese flavor to stand out. We like to think that the
chunks of blue cheese are what sets our dressing apart from any other Blue Cheese on the shelf.
Thousand Island is making a come back amongst the younger customer. 

<h3>Thousand Island</h3>
We have a top of the line, great
tasting Thousand Island that not only is great on salads but is even better on sandwiches and burgers. We
have many customers who purchase our Thousand Island to use on their prepared sandwiches that they
sell in their stores. We are proud to keep the love of Thousand Island continuing to the next generation.

<h3>Salsa</h3>
We offer three salsas, Hot, Medium, and Mild. Each salsa is made with fresh ingredients and we like to
make sure our customer is satisfied with their degree of hotness! For the mild we use various onions and
Jalapeno Peppers, for the Medium we take that and add Serrano Peppers, and to make sure our Hot Salsa
customers are happy we had Habaneros with the Serrano and Jalapeno Peppers. At any degree we know
our customer is going to come back for more!</p>

<h3>Our new flavors are as follows:</h3>
Cilantro Lime Ranch: creamy ranch dressing with fresh cilantro and a
twist of lime.<br>
Southwest Ranch: Tomatillos, fire roasted jalapenos, and crushed red
peppers in our creamy ranch dressing.<br>
Jalapeno Ranch: Our famous Ranch dressing with a kick<br>
Parmesan Peppercorn Ranch: Creamy ranch dressing with parmesan
cheese, and crushed peppercorns.<br>
Raspberry Poppy seed Vinaigrette: A sweet mixture of raspberry,
poppyseeds, and vinegar to create a refreshing dressing.<br><br>
